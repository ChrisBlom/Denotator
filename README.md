Denotator
=========

Denotator is a light-weight libary for Haskell that allows you the use GHCi to play with semantics for formal languages.

Semantics is a subfield from linguistics. It focuses on the relation between signifiers, like words, phrases, signs, and symbols, and what they stand for, their denotation.
Formal semantics uses tools from mathematical logic and computer science to study meaning: 
sets, functions, types, lambda calculus, hell ... even monads!

Formal semantics and functional programming share a common ancestry: this is why it is possible
to implement a lot of topics in semantics in Haskell. 
This project aims to make it as simple as possible to do semantics in Haskell.
